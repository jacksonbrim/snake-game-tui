https://github.com/jacksonbrim/snake-game-tui/assets/9915390/39ba4788-cbe5-4cfc-bd43-f259718b646a

## Overview
A minimalist, terminal-based Snake game in Rust, leveraging the `ratatui` crate for the user interface and designed with MVC architecture. Originally an easter egg within another TUI project's loading page, this game provides a nostalgic Snake gameplay directly in your terminal.

## Features
- **Movement**: Control the snake using the directional arrows or Vim bindings (`k`, `j`, `h`, `l`).
- **Pause/Unpause**: Toggle game pause with the spacebar.
- **Boost Mode**: Accelerate the snake's movement by pressing `b`.

## Requirements
- Rust and Cargo installed on your system.

## Installation
Clone the repository and run the game using Cargo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jacksonbrim/snake-game-tui.git
cd terminal-snake-game
cargo run
```

## Controls
- Arrow keys or `k`, `j`, `h`, `l` for navigation.
- Spacebar to pause/unpause the game.
- `b` to activate boost mode.
